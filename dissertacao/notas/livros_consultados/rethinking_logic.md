# Rethinking Logic: Logic in Relation to Mathematics, Evolution and Method

**Autor:** Carlo Cellucci

## Overview

Comecei a ler este livro esperando uma coisa e recebi outra. É um livro muito focado em re-pensar a lógica matemática, portanto questiona muito seu uso e sua importância na descoberta de novas coisas. Apesar disso, gostei muito de certos trechos que acho que podem ser utilizados justamente na introdução da *minha* dissertação, justamente por ser mais generalista.

### Capítulo 1 - Introdução

#### Quotes

> [...] The "attack on mathematics is part of a general assault agains reason". Actually, almost the opposite is the case. What is against reason is, rather, to place mathematics in an unlikely paradise of eternal, unrevisable truths, instead of taking it for what it realyu is, fallible, revisable, and evolving, like natural science.

> After decades of fruitless to establish the absolute certainty of mathematics, Russell admitted: "I wanted certainty in the kind of way in which people want religious faith. I thought that certainty is more likely to be found in mathematics than elsewhere." [...] Recognizing that one cannot find splendid certainty in mathematics is the starting point for any realistic philosophy of mathematics.

> The alternative to the top-down approach is the bottom-up approach, according to which:
> 1) A mathematics field is developed from below, that is, from problems of that field or from problems of other mathematics, natural science or social science fields.
> 2) It is developed by the analytic method, which is an upward path from problems to hypotheses derived non-deductively from them.
> [...]
> Another example is Turing's approach to computability, which is based on an analysis of the actions of a human being who is making a calculation.

> Frege himself stated that mathematical logic is a device invented for certain scientific purposes, and one must not condemn it because it is not suited to others.

> According to Frege, "we can inquire, on one hand, how we have gradually arrived at a given proposition and, on the other, how we can finally provide it with the most secure foundation." [...] logic must concern itself "not with the way in which" mathematical propositions "are discovered but with the kind of ground on which their" justification "rests."

> An alternative logic paradigm is necessary if logic is to play any significant role in scientific research. [...] Its concepts "were invented one day for the purpose of dealing with a certain model of the world" which is "inadequate to the needs of the new sciences."

> [...] Mathematical logic "is rather detached from actual knowledge" because, instead of being concerned with the process of knowledge acquisition, it "seems to be concerned only with end results".

> [...] While mathematical logic, being a logic of justification, is only aimed at systematizing and justifying what is already known. [...]

### Capítulo 2 - The Origin of Logic

#### Quotes

**2.8 - An Articulated View of the Origin of Logic**

> [...] What is the origin of logic and its relation to method?
> (A) That rational faculty which all human beings have.
> (B) The development of procedures for acquiring knowledge.
> (C) The systematic study of procedures for acquiring knowledge.

**2.13 - Origin of the Name 'Logic'**

> [...] What is the origin of the name 'logic'?
> 'Logic' translates *logike*, an adjective which derives from *logos* and is often attached to *techne* [art] or *episteme* [science]. Now *logos* means discourse, argument, reasoning, faculty of reasoning, reason. Therefore *logike techne* means the art of reasoning, or reason, and *logike episteme* the science of reasoning, or reason.

> [...] Thus Aristotle claims to be the originator of logic as a subject

### Capítulo 10 - Frege's Approach to Logic

Explica bem as ideias de Frege e apresenta alguns argumentos sobre elas.
